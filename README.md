# todolist_Colt
My rendition of Colt Steele's To-Do List tutorial.

Made using HTML/CSS/Javascript and JQuery (Kept fairly basic)

Need to add a database, time stamp, calendar to list to do's, notifications. (Possibly create a chrome ext.)

Hag in this case is referring to a witch, to go along with the wizardry theme.
